### Easy customization
Butter is built with <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwindcss</ExternalLink>, but you can also write custom CSS directly below the component using `<style>`.

### Clean and smooth design

### Microinteractions  
Butter adds subtle animations and interactions that enhance the user experience, making your product enjoyable.

## Our principles
> Butter was born because, as a developer, I always wanted components that were pleasant to look at, easy to integrate, and with animations that werenâ€™t intrusive. After exploring several libraries that, for the most part, didnâ€™t meet my expectations, I decided to create Butter so you can build amazing interfaces without overcomplicating things.
