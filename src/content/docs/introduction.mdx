### Easy customization
Butter is built with <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwindcss</ExternalLink>, but you can also write custom CSS directly below the component using `<style>`.

### Clean and smooth design
Each component is designed to be simple yet stylish, making it look great in any project.

### Microinteractions  
Butter adds subtle animations and interactions that enhance the user experience, making your product enjoyable.

## Our principles
> Butter was born because, as a developer, I always wanted components that were pleasant to look at, easy to integrate, and with animations that weren’t intrusive. After exploring several libraries that, for the most part, didn’t meet my expectations, I decided to create Butter so you can build amazing interfaces without overcomplicating things.
